- **'howto_import_custom_modules.ipynb'** has instructions for importing a custom module into your Google Colab noteboook.

class files have the exact same functionality as the complete module but using only classes and methods.

func file have the exact same functionality as the complete module but using only functions.

Make sure to use the file type that better suits you, .ipynb or .py, note that they were made in Google Colab notebooks (.ipynb).
